These GitHub beginner exercises for a treasure hunt involve tasks aimed at teaching teams fundamental Git and GitHub operations:

Initializing a Repository: Teams clone a repository, create a README file, commit it, and push changes to their team's branch.

Collaborating on a Secret Code: Teams fork a repository, create a new branch, make changes to a decoding guide, commit, push, and create a pull request for review.

Tracking Changes in Manuscripts: Teams add multiple versions of an ancient manuscript to the repository, commit each version with relevant messages, and view the commit history.

Resolving Conflicts in Expedition Notes: Teams fetch updates, merge them into their local branch, resolve conflicts if any, commit the changes, and push the final version to GitHub.

Reverting Changes in Artifact Documentation: Teams identify a commit with correct documentation, revert to that commit, and push the changes to GitHub.

These exercises are designed to simulate real-world scenarios, helping teams practice essential Git commands like clone, branch, commit, push, fetch, merge, revert, and view commit history.
